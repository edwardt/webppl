# How to contribute

We appreciate third-party contributions.

To make a contribution, follow these steps:

1. Submit an issue for your contribution, or describe your proposed changes by commenting on an existing issue related to your contribution.
2. Fork, then clone the webppl repository.
3. Install webppl from GitHub (see [README.md](README.md)).
4. Make sure all tests and style checks pass by running `grunt`.
5. Apply your changes, including tests.
6. Run `grunt` again to verify that tests and checks still pass. Run `fixjsstyle` if style problems are discovered.
7. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

For very minor contributions, e.g. to comments and documentation, you do not need to create a ticket. You can directly submit a pull request by editing the corresponding file on github.
